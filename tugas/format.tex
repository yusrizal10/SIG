%%%%%%% Demo of section head containing sample macro:
%% To get a macro to expand correctly in a section head, with upper and
%% lower case math, put the definition and set the box 
%% before \begin{document}, so that when it appears in the 
%% table of contents it will also work:

\newcommand{\VT}[1]{\ensuremath{{V_{T#1}}}}

%% use a box to expand the macro before we put it into the section head:

\newbox\sectsavebox
\setbox\sectsavebox=\hbox{\boldmath\VT{xyz}}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% End Demo


Other commands, and notes on usage:

-----
Possible section head levels:
\section{Introduction}
\subsection{This is subsection}
\subsubsection{This is subsubsection}
\paragraph{This is the paragraph}

-----
Tables:
 Remember to use \centering for a small table and to start the table
 with \hline, use \hline underneath the column headers and at the end of 
 the table, i.e.,

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Small Table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\hline
one&two&three\\
\hline
C&D&E\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

For a table that expands to the width of the page, write

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{@{\extracolsep{\fill}}lcc}
\hline
....
\end{tabular*}
%% Sample table notes:
\begin{tablenotes}
$^a$Refs.~19 and 20.

$^b\kappa, \lambda>1$.
\end{tablenotes}
\end{table}

Algorithm.
Maintains same fonts as text (as opposed to verbatim which uses fixed
width fonts). Space at beginning of line will be maintained if you
use \ at beginning of line.

\begin{algorithm}
{\bf state\_transition algorithm} $\{$
\        for each neuron $j\in\{0,1,\ldots,M-1\}$
\        $\{$   
\            calculate the weighted sum $S_j$ using Eq. (6);
\            if ($S_j>t_j$)
\                    $\{$turn ON neuron; $Y_1=+1\}$   
\            else if ($S_j<t_j$)
\                    $\{$turn OFF neuron; $Y_1=-1\}$   
\            else
\                    $\{$no change in neuron state; $y_j$ remains %
unchanged;$\}$ .
\        $\}$   
$\}$   
\end{algorithm}
